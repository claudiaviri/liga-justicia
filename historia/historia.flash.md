# Historia de Flash

Gitosis is a tool which provides access control and remote management for hosted Git repositories. It allows for fine-grained management of read and write access over SSH, without requiring that the users have local system accounts on the server. To do this, it sets up a single system account git which is then used for all Git access.

Gitosis provides installation instructions in its README file. This guide is based on those instructions
